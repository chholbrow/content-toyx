      <solution>
        <font color="blue">Answer: </font>
        <font color="blue"> a) it is wrong to say that electric potential energy is a property of the electric field; strictly speaking it is a property of the charge and the field; b) it is common to speak of the 'electric potential energy of a charge,' but it is really the potential energy of a charge in some particular electric field, so this answer is not satisfactory. c) True. Electric potential energy is a property of a charge in an electric field. A change of the value of either, changes the magnitude of the electric potential energy. d) This is correct. An electrostatic field [mathjaxinline]\vec{E}[/mathjaxinline] will accelerate a charge [mathjaxinline]q[/mathjaxinline], increasing or decreasing its kinetic energy and consequently decreasing or increasing its electric potential energy.  </font>
