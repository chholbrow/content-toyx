  <p>
What is &#x201C;electric potential energy"? What is &#x201C;electric potential"? How do the two concepts differ? How are the two concepts related? </p>
  <p>
Why is it that only differences in electric potential energy are physically significant? Is it also true that only differences in electric potential are physically significant? Why? </p>
